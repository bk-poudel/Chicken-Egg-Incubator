# Chicken Egg Incubator
This project is for creating a chicken egg incubator using PlatformIO.

## Libraries Used/Required

- `DHT.h`: For reading temperature and humidity from DHT sensors. [Download](https://github.com/adafruit/DHT-sensor-library)
- `Servo.h`: For controlling the servo motor. [Download](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/Servo)
- `LiquidCrystal.h`: For controlling the LCD display. [Download](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/LiquidCrystal)
- `Wire.h`: For I2C communication with sensors and the LCD display. [Download](https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-avr/tree/master/libraries/Wire)
- `Adafruit_Sensor.h`: Unified sensor library for interfacing with various sensors. [Download](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Sensor)
